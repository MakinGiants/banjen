# Privacy Policy

**Last updated: February 17, 2026**

Daniel Gomez ("Developer", "I", "me", or "my") operates the Banjen - Android Banjo Tuner mobile application (the "App"). This Privacy Policy explains how information is collected, used, and disclosed when you use the App.

By using the App, you agree to the collection and use of information in accordance with this Privacy Policy.

## Information Collection and Use

The App is designed as a simple banjo tuner tool. I do not directly collect, store, or process any personal information from users. The App does not require you to create an account, provide your name, email address, or any other personally identifiable information.

However, the App uses third-party services that may collect information used to identify you.

### Third-Party Services

The App uses the following third-party services:

#### Google AdMob

The App displays advertisements provided by Google AdMob. Google AdMob may collect and use data to serve personalized or non-personalized ads. This data may include:

- Device identifiers (e.g., advertising ID)
- IP address
- General location information (e.g., city-level)
- App usage data and interaction with advertisements
- Device information (e.g., device model, operating system version)

For more information on how Google collects and processes data, please review the [Google Privacy Policy](https://policies.google.com/privacy) and [How Google Uses Information from Sites or Apps That Use Our Services](https://policies.google.com/technologies/partner-sites).

#### Google Play Services

The App relies on Google Play Services, which may collect certain device and usage information. Please refer to the [Google Play Services Privacy Policy](https://policies.google.com/privacy) for details.

## Permissions

The App requests the following permissions:

- **Internet Access**: Required to load advertisements and for basic app functionality.
- **Network State Access**: Used to check network connectivity for loading advertisements.

## Data Retention

Since I do not collect personal data directly, I do not retain any personal data. Third-party services (such as Google AdMob) retain data according to their own data retention policies.

## Children's Privacy

The App is not directed at children under the age of 13. I do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. If you are a parent or guardian and believe your child has provided personal information through the App, please contact me so I can take appropriate action.

## Security

I value your trust and strive to use commercially acceptable means of protecting any information processed by the App. However, no method of transmission over the Internet or method of electronic storage is 100% secure, and I cannot guarantee absolute security.

## Your Rights

Depending on your jurisdiction, you may have certain rights regarding your personal data, including:

- **Access**: The right to request access to your data.
- **Deletion**: The right to request deletion of your data.
- **Opt-Out**: The right to opt out of personalized advertising. You can reset your advertising ID or opt out of personalized ads through your device settings.

### California Residents (CalOPPA / CCPA)

If you are a California resident, you have the right to request disclosure of the categories of personal information collected about you, the sources of that information, the business purpose for collecting it, and the categories of third parties with whom it is shared. You also have the right to request deletion of your personal information. To exercise these rights, please contact me using the information below.

### European Economic Area Residents (GDPR)

If you are located in the European Economic Area, you have certain data protection rights under the General Data Protection Regulation. These include the right to access, rectify, or erase your personal data, and the right to restrict or object to processing. To exercise these rights, please contact me using the information below.

## Changes to This Privacy Policy

I may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted on this page with an updated "Last updated" date. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes. Changes are effective when posted on this page.
